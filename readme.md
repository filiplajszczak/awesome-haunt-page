### [Awesome Haunt](https://awesome.haunt.page/)

#### Collection of sites made with and stuff about [Haunt](https://dthompson.us/projects/haunt.html)

Following was created as a list of resources collected to learn Haunt by
example.

It was deployed as a site in the process of dogfooding and later expanded to include
more sites created with Haunt and other resources about it.
